# SD Card Fonts

CrossPoint supports loading additional fonts from the SD card, including fonts
with extended Unicode coverage (CJK, Cyrillic, Greek, etc.).

If CrossPoint enables external RAM on your device, you can load `.ttf`, `.otf`,
and `.ttc` files directly. Otherwise, convert them to `.cpfont` files first.
All devices can use `.cpfont` files.

## Installing Fonts

There are three ways to install `.cpfont` fonts. Direct TTF/OTF/TTC loading uses
the manual SD card copy method below.

### Option 1: Download from device (recommended)

1. Connect your CrossPoint reader to Wi-Fi
2. Go to **Settings > Reader > Manage Fonts**
3. Browse available font families and tap to download
4. A single download selects that family and opens **Text Settings** for
   preview. **Download All** prefers `NotoSansSC` (or the first valid catalog
   family when it is absent); **Update All** keeps the current selection.
   Each operation uses one byte-weighted progress bar across all of its font
   files and refreshes it after at least 10 percentage points of progress.
5. Preview any family or size you want. Leaving **Text Settings** caches only
   the final SD font and size in internal Flash. The preprocessing page appears
   because a download marks the selected font as changed; ordinary layout or
   style edits do not trigger it.

### Option 2: Upload via web browser

1. Start **File Transfer** and connect through **Join Network** or **Create Hotspot**
2. Open the web interface URL shown on the reader
3. Navigate to the **Fonts** tab
4. Upload `.cpfont` files using the upload form

### Option 3: Manual SD card copy

1. Download font files from the
   [crosspoint-fonts repository](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-fonts)
2. Copy font family folders to one of two locations on your SD card:

   - `/.fonts/` — hidden directory (preferred; keeps the SD root tidy
     when mounted on a desktop)
   - `/fonts/` — visible directory (use this if your OS hides dot-files
     and you'd rather see the folder in your file manager)

   Both roots are always scanned at boot and the results are merged: a
   family installed in `/fonts/` shows up even when `/.fonts/` also
   exists, and vice versa. The two roots only collide if the same family
   name appears in both — in that case the copy in `/.fonts/` wins and
   the duplicate in `/fonts/` is ignored.

       SD Card Root/
       ├── .fonts/                     ← Hidden root (preferred)
       │   └── Literata/
       │       ├── Literata_12.cpfont
       │       ├── Literata_14.cpfont
       │       ├── Literata_16.cpfont
       │       └── Literata_18.cpfont
       └── fonts/                      ← Visible root (equally valid)
           └── Merriweather/
               ├── Merriweather_12.cpfont
               └── ...

3. Insert the SD card and power on your CrossPoint reader

## Missing Glyphs in the User Interface
### Direct TTF/OTF/TTC fonts

If CrossPoint enables external RAM on your device, copy a `.ttf`, `.otf`, or
`.ttc` file directly into `/fonts/` or `/.fonts/`. The filename without its
extension becomes the family name. For example, `/fonts/Bookerly.ttf` appears as
`Bookerly` in **Settings > Reader > Font Family**.

For a family with separate styles, put its files in one subfolder. The folder
name becomes the family name. For example:

    /fonts/Bookerly/Bookerly-Regular.ttf
    /fonts/Bookerly/Bookerly-Bold.ttf
    /fonts/Bookerly/Bookerly-Italic.ttf
    /fonts/Bookerly/Bookerly-BoldItalic.ttf

The reader selects regular, bold, italic, and bold italic faces from the font
files. One regular file is enough; the reader derives missing styles. A `.cpfont`
file in the same family folder takes priority over TTF/OTF/TTC files, so keep
the two formats in separate folders. If both font roots contain the same family
name, the copy in `/.fonts/` takes priority.

Direct fonts use the standard reader sizes: 12, 14, 16, and 18 pt. The **Fonts**
tab in File Transfer accepts `.cpfont` files only. Copy direct fonts to the SD
card instead. To remove a loose font file, delete that file from the SD card.
The Fonts page can delete families stored in subfolders.

## CJK in the User Interface

Unified firmware registers embedded Simplified-Chinese 8/10/12pt subsets as
fallbacks for the compact international UI fonts.

On ESP32-S3 devices with working PSRAM and at least the existing 256 KiB
PSRAM reserve, the selected SD font family also supplies matching 8/10/12pt
UI fallbacks. Install those exact sizes alongside your reader size. The loader
probes Han, Hiragana, Katakana, Hangul, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, Thai,
and Devanagari coverage before loading extra sizes. Missing files or failed
loads leave the embedded fallback in place. No fonts are downloaded automatically.

As upstream does, when the primary font lacks a non-ASCII character covered by
the SD fallback, the entire string is measured and drawn using that face.
This is not per-character font mixing: a string mixing scripts still needs a
font covering those scripts. If the SD face cannot supply any missing character,
the embedded Chinese subset is tried next. Unloading or switching SD fonts
preserves that embedded fallback.

C3, devices without PSRAM, and simulators keep only the selected reader-size
`.cpfont` resident. Japanese, Korean, Traditional Chinese, and uncommon Han
glyphs outside the embedded subsets may still show replacement boxes there.
The built-in 12pt reader subset remains an offline fallback.
The fallback is **size-matched**. The built-in UI fonts render at 8 pt
(small/author lines), 10 pt (list rows) and 12 pt (book-cover titles, headers),
so CrossPoint loads your SD family at those sizes too and maps each UI font to
its same-size SD font. CJK book names therefore appear at the same size as the
Latin text around them. A `.cpfont` family must contain files at sizes
**8, 10 and 12** for this UI fallback (in addition to the reader sizes 12–18).
Any missing UI size keeps showing boxes for CJK at that size. Direct
TTF/OTF/TTC families use the same file at all three UI sizes.

For `.cpfont` families, **Settings > Reader > Font Size** lists every size the family ships,
so a family built at 8,10,12,14,16,18 offers all six as reading sizes — the UI
sizes are not hidden from the list. Reading at 8 pt is your call; if you would
rather not see the small sizes there, convert two families (one with the UI
sizes for fallback, one with only the reading sizes you want).

When converting your own font, include the UI sizes:

    python3 lib/EpdFont/scripts/fontconvert_sdcard.py \
      MyCJKFont-Regular.otf \
      --intervals cjk \
      --sizes 8,10,12,14,16,18 \
      --style regular \
      --name MyCJKFont \
      --output-dir ./MyCJKFont/

What this means in practice:

- Select a CJK-capable SD font under **Settings > Reader > Font Family**
  (see [Installing Fonts](#installing-fonts) and the `cjk` / `hangul` presets
  for `.cpfont` under [Converting Custom Fonts](#converting-custom-fonts)). That single
  selection drives both book content *and* size-matched CJK fallback in the UI.
- Pure-Latin UI strings keep the crisp built-in font; only strings that
  actually contain CJK are routed to the SD font.
- The fallback is per *string*, not per glyph: a mixed title such as
  `三体 Vol.1` renders entirely in the SD font (including the Latin part). If
  that SD font is a `Mono` family, the Latin portion will appear half/full
  width.
- If no SD font is selected (a built-in reading font is active), there is no
  CJK fallback and the UI again shows boxes for CJK — pick a CJK SD font to
  restore it.

## Available Pre-Built Fonts

The current list of pre-built fonts is maintained in the
[crosspoint-fonts repository](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-fonts).

Unified firmware loads the manifest through `crossmux.cn` for China profiles
and `crossmux.com` for Global profiles; it does not select GitHub or Gitee
directly. Both catalogs publish manifest v1 with a valid
`baseUrl`, family/file names, non-zero file sizes, and CRC32 values. Every
referenced asset must be cpfont v4 and provide the coverage promised by its
catalog maintainer. Font sources and catalog-generation configuration are not
kept in this repository.

In a Chinese EPUB, confirming the incomplete-font prompt starts an automatic
reader-only flow: connect Wi-Fi, download and verify the complete `NotoSansSC`
family, and save the exact current point size. It then silently restarts before
loading the font, avoiding the fragmented heap left by Wi-Fi/TLS, and preprocesses
that size on the clean boot before returning to the same book and visible text
position. Page numbers can change because the new font repaginates the book. Back
or Wi-Fi cancellation returns to the book without changing the selection, while
Home always returns to Home. Download or clean-boot font-load errors offer Retry
and Back. A preprocessing failure keeps the verified SD font, disables Flash
acceleration, and returns after one notice.

The manual font manager and the prompt opened from Text Settings keep the
interactive preview flow described above.

## Converting Custom Fonts

To make `.cpfont` files for any device, convert your TrueType/OpenType fonts:

### Prerequisites

    pip install freetype-py fonttools

### Single font (one style)

    python3 lib/EpdFont/scripts/fontconvert_sdcard.py \
      MyFont-Regular.ttf \
      --intervals latin-ext \
      --sizes 12,14,16,18 \
      --style regular \
      --name MyFont \
      --output-dir ./MyFont/

### Multi-style font

    python3 lib/EpdFont/scripts/fontconvert_sdcard.py \
      --regular MyFont-Regular.ttf \
      --bold MyFont-Bold.ttf \
      --italic MyFont-Italic.ttf \
      --bolditalic MyFont-BoldItalic.ttf \
      --intervals latin-ext \
      --sizes 12,14,16,18 \
      --name MyFont \
      --output-dir ./MyFont/

**Text Settings > Style > Synthetic Bold** replaces EPUB bold faces with the
regular or italic face thickened by one (Light), two (Standard), or three
(Heavy) horizontal pixels at render time. It does not change font metrics,
wrapping, or the `.cpfont` format, and it does not affect menus or status-bar
text. Standard is the default; existing Standard and Heavy choices retain their
names and move to the stronger two- and three-pixel effects on upgrade.

You can also specify arbitrary Unicode ranges directly:
`--intervals latin-ext,(0x2100-0x214F)`

To list all presets with codepoint counts:

    python3 lib/EpdFont/scripts/fontconvert_sdcard.py --list-presets

### Additional options

`--force-autohint` — force FreeType's auto-hinter instead of the font's native hinting (useful when a font's built-in hints produce poor results at small sizes).

Install custom fonts via the web interface or manual SD card copy.
